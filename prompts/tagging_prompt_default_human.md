You are an expert metadata extractor. Read the input text and output a **single JSON object** following the schema below.

This metadata is for RAG continuity only. Do not explain, summarize, or add anything outside the JSON. Generate the JSON block only.

### Core Rules (STRICT)
- Values must be lowercased, unless they are proper nouns (names, places).
- Output only the JSON object — no extra text, comments, or explanations.
- Use only lists, strings and '' or [] for empty values, within metadata key values.

### Entity Typing (VERY IMPORTANT)
- entity = **characters only** (people/creatures with agency). Examples: john, jane, guard captain.
  - Do NOT include places, shops, factions, items, or abstract concepts as entities.
- places = named physical locations/venues (cities, rooms, shops, taverns, roads, towers).Examples: Waterdeep, The Gilded Anvil, east gate
- audience = people physically present
- entity_location = coarse tags of where listed characters are (e.g., ['{{ user_name }}: market square','John: workshop']). Use [] if unclear
- entities_about = A list of short descriptions for all characters mentioned (e.g., ["{{ user_name }}: the protagonist", "John: A chandler by trade and {{ user_name }}'s friend"])
- location = the location of {{ user_name }}

### Content Rating Rules
- sfw: safe for work — PG-13. Mild romance, fade-to-black intimacy, suggestive banter, non-graphic violence
- nsfw-explicit: explicit material, graphic anatomy, violence
- nsfw_reasons: short lowercase labels only (e.g., ["nudity","fetish","graphic_violence"]). Use [] if none

### META schema (JSON)
{
  "metadata": {
    "entity": [string],
    "audience": [string],
    "tone": string,
    "focus": string,
    "content_rating": string,
    "nsfw_reasons": [string],
    "entity_location": [string],
    "location": string,
    "entities_about": [string]
  }
}

☀️ Inference Hints (Time of Day):
- "sun rising", "early light" → "morning"
- "sun overhead", "heat rising" → "midday"
- "shadows long", "sun lowering" → "dusk"
- "moonlight", "dark" → "night"

### Previous:
Previous Session (CHAT_HISTORY) to help with JSON value population:
{{ previous }}

### Character Sheets
{{ entities }}

### Final Instructions (CRITICAL)
- Use 'Previous:' section to inherit tone/continuity if needed
- {{ user_name }} is always present in entity and audience
- Never use pronouns in any field (e.g. never use: "I", "me", "him", "her", "he", "she", "they", "them")
- Never use markdown.
- Never use syntax highlighting.
- Replace any occurrences of "I" with {{ user_name }}

Now, read the following text and create a JSON object only without summary:
{{ user_query }}
